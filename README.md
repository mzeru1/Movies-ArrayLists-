**Movies (ArrayLists)**

Create an application which will prompt the user to enter the name of their favorite Movie. Add the Movie to an array list.  Use a loop to continue adding movies to the array until the user presses q or Q. 

Once the user presses Q then print the list of movies before exiting the program.

HINT: You can use the .toLowerCase() method of the String class to convert the 'Q' to 'q'. So if your response is stored in a variable called userAnswer then userAnswer.toLowerCase() will evaluate to a 'q'. Alternatively, you can use the userAnswer.equalsIgnoreCase("q") method.

BONUS: Print out the list of movies sorted in alphabetical order.

BONUS x2: Suggest a movie to the user to watch by randomly selecting a movie from the list of movies entered.
